## Component Anatomy (Standard Structure)

Every component in UniqueUI follows a consistent architecture:

```
registry/
  └── {component-name}.tsx      ← Source component file
registry/config.ts              ← Registry metadata (deps, tailwind config)
registry.json                   ← Auto-generated (via build:registry script)
apps/www/components/ui/
  └── {component-name}.tsx      ← Copy used in the docs site
```

### Required Exports per Component

```tsx
// 1. Named export(s) for the component
export function ComponentName({ ...props }: ComponentProps) { ... }

// 2. TypeScript props interface
export interface ComponentProps {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  // ... component-specific props
}
```

### Registry Entry Format

```ts
{
  name: "component-name",
  dependencies: ["motion", "clsx", "tailwind-merge"],
  files: [
    { path: "component-name.tsx", type: "registry:ui" },
    { path: "utils/cn.ts", type: "registry:util", content: "..." }
  ],
  tailwindConfig: {
    theme: { extend: { animation: {}, keyframes: {} } }
  }
}
```

## Installation (End User)

# Install CLI globally
npm i -g uniqueui-cli

# Initialize in your project

## Design Principles

1. **Animation-First** — Every component MUST have meaningful motion. No static-only components.
2. **Physics-Based** — Prefer spring animations (`type: "spring"`) over linear/eased for natural feel.
3. **Performant** — Use `transform` and `opacity` only. Avoid layout-triggering properties in animations.
4. **Composable** — Components accept `className`, render as slots, and compose with each other.
5. **Accessible** — Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Provide `aria` attributes. Keyboard navigable.
6. **Copy-Paste Ready** — Each component is self-contained. One file, one install command, zero config.

---

## Contributing a New Component

1. Create `registry/{component-name}.tsx`
2. Add entry to `registry/config.ts` with dependencies and tailwind config
3. Run `pnpm build:registry` to regenerate `registry.json`
4. Add a showcase demo in `apps/www/app/page.tsx`
5. Test with `uniqueui add {component-name}` in a fresh project

---

> **Total: 70 animated components** across 13 categories — zero basic/static primitives.
